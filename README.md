# ML_Project_Used_Car_Price_Prediction
Developed a Machine Learning application that predicts the price of Used Cars.              
Project Title: Used Car Price Prediction.
I have developed this machine learning model using LinearRegression algorithm.
In this model predicts the price of used cars on various pparameters such as 'year','owner type','kilometers driven','fuel type' etc.
In the data set fuel type=1->Pretol,fuel type=2->Diesel,fuel type=3->CNG.
similarly for owner type=1->first,owner type=2->second,owner type=3->third.
similarly for Transmission=0->Manual,Transmission=1->Automatic.
Based on given input model predicts the price of the car.
